1,Great app. Only issue is that it doesn't tell you your card entry has expired untill you try to buy a ticket.
2,Very useful app. But the latest update (august 2022) forced me to reconfigure all the application settings
3,"I like this app a lot, clean, fast, does the job. "
4,"Pretty OK for what it's supposed to do. Graphical presentation and interface is a bit dated and unappealing. Functionally, though, this is a 5 star!"
5,"Great, but in display fingerprint is not working in Oneplus 6T."
6,It works perfectly. I don't have any complaints for now.
7,Quick and easy public transport payment.
8,Fast and comfortable way to pay for bus rides
9,The best option to buy tickts with the mobile in Cluj.

14,Cannot add more than one debit or credit card. Kindly do not suggest to use third parties like Google / Apple pay.
15,"Unfortunately, even after the upgrading from BPAY it's still not possible to buy a number of tickets and activate them consecutively over a period of time."
16,"Low level of documentation for each category. Looks buggy and unfinished, like an application made by amateurs."
17,"Very practical in theory, but I'm having some issues with my card"
18,It takes an insane amount of time to navigate through the menus every time just to get to the same ticket.
19,It asked me to validate phone number via sms twice. The second time it didn't allow me to input the number.
20,The app works very hard sometimes. It takes forever to load at every step.

22,It stops working the second time I used it.
